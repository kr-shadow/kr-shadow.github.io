The third\r\nline after title and date gives the source and revision number of the\r\nfile, this can be used to recover such information and other metadata\r\nif this turns out to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe texts show the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n - \"*\" at the start of line indicator the start of a text section\r\n   (mostly relevant to KR6 texts)\r\n - \"(\" and \")\" indicate start and end of intralinear insertsions,\r\n   which usually constitute a separate text flow out of band with the\r\n   main text.\r\n - All representations of non-representable characters have been\r\n   replaced with ad-hoc character codes from the Unicode Private Use\r\n   Area. A list of such representations as generated through the\r\n   conversion process is in gaiji.txt. The purpose of this way of\r\n   handling such characters is to make them distinguishable and make\r\n   it possible to calculate characteristics.  A program should not\r\n   depend on the stability of these codepoints across updates to the\r\n   files here.\r\n",
